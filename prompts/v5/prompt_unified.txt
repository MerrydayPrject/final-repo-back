UNIFIED VIRTUAL TRY-ON PIPELINE — V5 (Hair & Expression Lock)
================================================================================

INPUT IMAGES:
- Image 1: Person (Identity, Face, Hair, Expression Source)
- Image 2: Garment/Outfit (The clothing to apply)
- Image 3: Background (The final scene)

================================================================================
PHASE 1: OUTFIT REPLACEMENT (STRICT)
================================================================================

TASK: APPLY THE OUTFIT FROM IMAGE 2 ONTO THE PERSON IN IMAGE 1.

MANDATORY "OVERWRITE" INSTRUCTIONS:
1. IGNORE ORIGINAL CLOTHING VOLUME. Use the estimated slimmer body shape underneath.
2. ERASE ORIGINAL COLORS & TEXTURES of the old clothes completely.
3. **PROTECT HEAD REGION**: The area above the neck (Face + Hair) is a "Protected Zone".

CONTEXT:
- Target: Complete replacement of attire.
- Constraint: **Face, Hairstyle, and Expression must remain IDENTICAL.**

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Apply the outfit from Image 2 (Length, Color, Material) exactly onto the person in Image 1.
- If the new outfit is sleeveless, generate realistic skin texture for the arms.
- If the new outfit is a short dress or skirt, generate realistic skin texture for the legs.
- Completely replace the footwear with shoes matching the new style.

================================================================================
PHASE 2: IDENTITY, HAIR & BACKGROUND INTEGRATION
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Composite the result into Background Image 3 while strictly preserving the person's head features.

IDENTITY & HAIR RULES (NEVER BREAK):
1. **EXPRESSION LOCK**: 
   - STRICTLY PRESERVE the original facial expression (smile, gaze direction, mouth shape).
   - Do NOT relax or change the emotion of the face.
2. **HAIRSTYLE LOCK**: 
   - STRICTLY PRESERVE the hairstyle from Image 1.
   - Do NOT change hair length, color, volume, or texture.
   - Do NOT let the background lighting alter the hair color significantly.
3. **FACE STRUCTURE**: 
   - Do NOT change the structural facial features or identity (eyes, nose, mouth, face shape).
   - Only subtle lighting adjustments on the skin are allowed for integration.

BACKGROUND COMPOSITION:
- Remove the original background behind the subject entirely.
- Use ONLY Background Image 3 as the final background.
- Place the person at a natural scale and perspective inside the scene.

LIGHTING AND COLOR MATCHING RULES:
- Match the global light direction and intensity to Image 3.
- Adjust the brightness of the **Body and Dress** to match the scene.
- **CAUTION WITH FACE/HAIR**: Apply lighting adjustments very gently to the face and hair to avoid changing their appearance or color.
- Ensure cast shadows and contact shadows are realistic.

================================================================================
WHAT TO AVOID (STRICT FINAL CHECK):
================================================================================
- **Don't change the hairstyle, hair color, or hair length.**
- **Don't change the facial expression (e.g., making a serious face smile).**
- Don't replace the person with a different individual.
- Don't leave traces of the original clothing.
- Don't change the dress design from Image 2.

================================================================================

1. The person's **Face, Hair, and Expression** are exactly from Image 1.
2. The person is wearing ONLY the outfit from Image 2.
