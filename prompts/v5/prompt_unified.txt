# MISSION: VIRTUAL TRY-ON (NATURAL LIGHTING INTEGRATION)

## CRITICAL SETTINGS
- **CREATIVITY:** 0% (Do not invent new features)
- **IDENTITY:** 100% (Preserve facial structure)
- **LIGHTING:** ADAPTIVE (Match background atmosphere)

## INPUTS
- [Image 1]: Target Person (Source of Identity).
- [Image 2]: Garment (Source of Outfit).
- [Image 3]: Background (Target Scene).

## 1. IDENTITY PRESERVATION (STRUCTURE LOCK)
- **THE RULE:** Keep the facial **GEOMETRY and FEATURES** of [Image 1] exactly the same, but adapt the **ILLUMINATION**.
- **ACTION:** Composite the head from [Image 1], but update its lighting to match the new scene.
- **ALLOWED:**
    - Apply the color temperature of [Image 3] to the face (e.g., warm sunset, cool neon).
    - Cast realistic shadows on the face consistent with the light direction in [Image 3].
- **PROHIBITED:**
    - DO NOT change the shape of eyes, nose, mouth, or jawline.
    - DO NOT apply heavy, high-contrast shadows that obscure the identity.
- **GOAL:** The face must look like it is physically present in the environment of [Image 3], not like a cutout sticker.

## 2. BODY & GARMENT GENERATION
- **TASK:** Generate the body wearing [Image 2] *below* the neck.
- **FIT:** Adapts the garment to the pose of [Image 1].
- **PHYSICS:** Ensure the cloth drapes naturally over the body shape.

## 3. BACKGROUND COMPOSITION & GLOBAL ILLUMINATION
- **SCENE:** Place the composited person into [Image 3].
- **LIGHTING HARMONY:** - Analyze the light source in [Image 3] (direction, intensity, color).
    - **Re-light BOTH the face and the garment** to match this light source.
    - Ensure the skin tone reacts naturally to the ambient light (e.g., slight blue tint in a shadow, golden tint in sun).
- **SHADOWS:** Cast a realistic contact shadow on the ground/floor based on the person's position.

## 4. OUTPUT QUALITY
- The final image must look like a cohesive photograph.
- **Prioritize "Photorealism" and "Lighting Consistency"** while maintaining the person's recognizable identity.
