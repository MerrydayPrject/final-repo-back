# MISSION: VIRTUAL TRY-ON (STRICT FACE CLONING MODE)

## CRITICAL SETTINGS
- **CREATIVITY:** 0% (Do not invent anything)
- **IDENTITY:** 100% (Bitwise copy of the face)

## INPUTS
- [Image 1]: Target Person (Source of Identity).
- [Image 2]: Garment (Source of Outfit).
- [Image 3]: Background (Target Scene).

## 1. FACE CLONING (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)
- **THE RULE:** You are NOT a painter. You are a COMPOSITOR.
- **ACTION:** Crop the head (face, hair, ears, neck) from [Image 1] and **PASTE** it onto the generated body.
- **PIXEL PRESERVATION:** The pixel values of the face region must remain identical to [Image 1].
- **PROHIBITED:**
    - DO NOT re-light the face heavily.
    - DO NOT sharpen or "enhance" the eyes/nose/mouth.
    - DO NOT change the skin texture of the face.
    - DO NOT alter the gaze direction.
- **INTEGRATION:** Only blend the *edges* of the neck where it meets the new clothes. The center of the face must be the original raw pixels.

## 2. BODY & GARMENT GENERATION
- **TASK:** Generate the body wearing [Image 2] *below* the neck.
- **FIT:** Adapts the garment to the pose of [Image 1].
- **HANDS/FEET:** If hands or feet are visible in [Image 1], keep their original shape and posture. Do not regenerate fingers if possible.

## 3. BACKGROUND COMPOSITION
- **SCENE:** Place the composited person into [Image 3].
- **LIGHTING:** Adjust the *garment's* lighting to match [Image 3].
- **FACE LIGHTING EXCEPTION:** Keep the face lighting NEUTRAL or consistent with [Image 1]. Do not force the background's strong lighting onto the face if it distorts the identity.

## 4. OUTPUT QUALITY
- The result should look like a "Head-Swap" where the original head is placed on a new body.
- If you must choose between "Realistic Lighting on Face" and "Original Identity", **CHOOSE IDENTITY.**
